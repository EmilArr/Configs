# Configs
My i3-gaps and i3blocks configs

# Using this
1. Applications:
    - feh
    - xterm
    - i3(-gaps), if you don't use i3-gaps then remove the i3gaps section in i3config
    - i3blocks
    - rofi
    - Things for i3blocks
2. You will need to change the paths to scripts and other stuff.
3. Change the rofi theme with `rofi-theme-selector`. I am using the *Arthur* theme.
4. Copy the files to the right locations
    + i3blocks --> .config/i3/i3blocks
    + i3config --> .config/i3/config
# I3blocks
